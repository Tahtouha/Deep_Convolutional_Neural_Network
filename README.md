# Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network
This is one of the models i used in my final masters project, DCGAN are generative models that take noise as input and depending on the data distribution of the dataset used for training it will generate images that are semantically and visually representative of the overall dataset.
The network consists of two main netsworks, a Generator model and a discriminator, following the orinigal GAN paper of Ian Goodfellow.
